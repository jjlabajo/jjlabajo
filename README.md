<h1 align="center">Hello World ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>My name is Joe. </p>

<p> I live in the Philippines. I've been a developer since 2018 when I got my degree in IT.</p>

<p>I work full time at New AlchemyðŸ”¥.</p>

<p> In my spare time I still create and tinker with back-end tech and also with new tech such as AI and Machine Learning.</p>

<q> I always believe that programming is also a form of art that combines both logical and creative part of a person.</q>

<p>Outside tech:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I enjoy Karaoke-ing with family or friends.</li>
  <li>I sometimes go for swimming as a form of meditation.</li>
  <li>I play Dota 2 and buy skins for bragging rights xD (My rank is just Legend) </li>
  <li>I play Valorant as well but only seldom, only when I miss the feeling of playing it.</li>
  <li>I go cafe-hopping especially to aesthetic ones.</li>
  <li>I also binge-watch anime or series, as in in one sitting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Music:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Imagine Dragons</li>
  <li>Twenty-one Pilots</li>
  <li>LoFi</li>
