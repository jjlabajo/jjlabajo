<h2 align="center">Hello World ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<p>My name is Joe. </p>

<p> I live in the Philippines. I've been a developer since 2018 when I got my degree in IT.</p>

  <li>I play Dota 2, Valorant and Chess, I usually buy game skins for plus damage and morale xD </li>
  <li>I also binge-watch anime or series, but i do have a particular taste hihi.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>Basically a coffee-blooded ramen-loving fashion-particular cat-petting techy otaku dad. ðŸ˜‚</p>
