<h1 align="center">Hello World ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>You can call me Joe. </p>

<p> I live in the Philippines and sometimes travel in some parts of Asia. I've been a developer since 2018 when I got my degree in IT.</p>

<p>I have attempted to create my own Software over the years. I have founded API Artisan, UnliBase and Backender.io - all of them are back-end development related.</p>
<p> In my spare time I still create and tinker with back-end tech and also with new tech such as AI and Machine Learning.</p>

<blockquote> I always believe that programming is also a form of art that combines both logical and creative part of a person.</blockquote>

<p>Outside tech:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I enjoy Karaoke-ing with family or friends.</li>
  <li>I sometimes go for swimming as a form of meditation.</li>
  <li>I play Dota 2 and buy skins for bragging rights xD (My rank is just Legend) </li>
  <li>I play Valorant as well but only seldom, only when I miss the feeling of playing it.</li>
  <li>I go cafe-hopping especially to aesthetic ones.</li>
  <li>I also binge-watch anime, as in in one sitting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Music:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Imagine Dragons</li>
  <li>Twenty-one Pilots</li>
  <li>LoFi</li>
  <li>Radwimps</li>
  <li>PH Rap (Loonie, Flow G, Apekz, Abra) </li>
</ul>
